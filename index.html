						<LI>Show myself, Eli.
						<LI>Introvert.

						<LI>History!
						<LI>My first website.
						<LI>A nationally touring band. (like BNL)
						<LI>I got this site by telling a friend his website was terrible and that I could do it better.
						<LI>Because I was not "employed" I had tons of freedom to try things. (podcasts, forums, membership model, ecommerce)
						<LI>Wrote my first perl code for Smallfish, spent some years booking the band.
						<LI>Small forum and wrote my own language filter. (eric calling me frantic with live dirty words on the site).
						<LI>Moved to PHP Nuke

				<section data-background="images/pokerpwnage.png">
					<aside class="notes">
						<LI>Launched in 08, sold in 10.
						<LI>We worked with online professional poker player and built a subscriber base of ~600 people.
						<LI>Site was built on moveable type (wp alternative). We were small.  I hated customer service.
						<LI>Our biggest competitor bought us out.
						<LI>We had a chemistry, but both were happy to leave it.
						<LI>I left web-dev...because of having to deal with people.
						<LI>You are thinking "why should I listen to this guy talk about communities"?

						<LI>Here's why...our food adventure series runs in 6 cities.
						<LI>We have built out a list of foodies that have created lines around buildings.
						<LI>I haven't timed this presentation...it is very different than what I wrote for WCORL.
						<LI>I experiment with my slides at meetups...
						<LI>So, I've tried to parallel my key points to actual events in my life.

					<h2>Have a purpose.</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						<LI>October of 2013 my brother-in-law called me.
						*no notes...tell the story of how JRR started*
						<LI>Maza...closed because no power.
						<LI>He called me the next day...we need to support Jax local restaurants.
						<LI>Maybe we'll find a revenue model...maybe not.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section data-background="images/jrr2.jpg">
					<h2>Meet your community in person.</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						<LI>Revenue model...we tried social media management...but we are bad at setting boundaries.
						<LI>We tried building websites and all sorts of other b2b service.
						<LI>Restaurants are broke (at least the kind we work with).
						<LI>Then we worked with Midori Sushi in Orange Park.  May of 2014.
						<LI>Did a sushi making class.
						<LI>Selling tickets is hard work.
						<LI>We sold 8...but we liked the model because we made money and the restaurants did as well.

					<h2>Apologize for your mistakes.</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						<LI>August of '14 we did our first "food adventure".
						<LI>The location was a place called Tres Leches on Stockton.
						<LI>We had this elaborate plan for how the event would go.
						<LI>But my brother-in-law had to come late...his son ended up in the ER with a bloody nose that just wouldn't stop.
						<LI>It was kind of my nightmare.
						<LI>We sold the place out! $29.99 for 6 courses.
						<LI>And we had foodies coming in and hugging us.
						<LI>We had all 39 seats sold...
						<LI>The meal took 3+ hours.
						<LI>But EVERYONE wanted to know where our next one was.

						<LI>Weird to list apologize at pt 3...but you're gonna make mistakes early on.
						<LI>Get in the habit of not being the smartest person in the room

						<LI>Our 2nd was at a place called Dirty Reds...ran out of food.
						<LI>Our 3rd was at a place called Tapa That...portions were small.

				<section data-background="images/potpie.jpg">
					<h2>Communicate consistently.</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						<LI>Somewhere in here, we started receiving invites to places.
						<LI>Which was it's own slippery slope.
						<LI>But, it was clear that our regulars were suggesting to their favorite places (that they may or may not hav had a relationship with) to contact us.
						<LI>It became clear to us that we had a "thing"
						<LI>We also had contributors at this point.
						<LI>So we had to set some specifics on how we do stuff.

					<h2>Know your audience.</h2>
					<aside class="notes">

						<LI>The chef was drinking...I was drinking...
