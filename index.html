						History! (Oct 2000 image).
						My first website.  A nationally touring Catholic/Lutheran band.
						I got this site by telling a friend his website was terrible and that I could do it better.
						Because I was not "employed" I had tons of freedom to try things. (podcasts, forums, membership model, ecommerce)
						Wrote my first perl/php code for Smallfish, spent some years booking the band.

						Launched in 08, sold in 10.
						We worked with online professional poker player and built a subscriber base of ~600 people.
						Site was built on moveable type (wp alternative). We were small.  I hated customer service.
						We had a chemistry, but both were happy to leave it.

						August of '14 we did our first "food adventure".
						The location was a place called Tres Leches on Stockton.
						We had this elaborate plan for how the event would go.
						But my brother-in-law had to come late...his son ended up in the ER with a bloody nose that just wouldn't stop.
						We sold the place out! $29.99 for 6 courses.
						And we had foodies coming in and hugging us.
						We had all 39 seats sold...
						The meal took nearly 3 hours.
						But EVERYONE wanted to know where our next one was.

						Our 2nd was at a place called Dirty Reds...closed
						Our 3rd was at a place called Tapa That...closed

						Jump to March of 2015.
						Our 10th foodie adventure.
						The first one I had to introduce.
						At this point my nephew was a patient at Duke University waiting for a stem cell transplant.
						I had to do the intro...we had TV coverage.
						It was a vegan event.  We didn't know we had to limit ticket sales...sold 80 tickets.
						If you're vegan I'm not picking on you...but the eclectic group we had convinced the owner to add a vegan sushi menu.
