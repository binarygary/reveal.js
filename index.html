						History! (Oct 2000 image).
						My first website.  A nationally touring Catholic/Lutheran band.
						I got this site by telling a friend his website was terrible and that I could do it better.
						Because I was not "employed" I had tons of freedom to try things. (podcasts, forums, membership model, ecommerce)
						Wrote my first perl/php code for Smallfish, spent some years booking the band.

					<aside class="notes">
						Launched in 08, sold in 10.
						We worked with online professional poker player and built a subscriber base of ~600 people.
						Site was built on moveable type (wp alternative). We were small.  I hated customer service.
